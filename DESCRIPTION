Description: Shiny web application to run meta-analyses. 
    Essentially a graphical front-end to package 'meta' for R. 
    Can be useful as an educational tool, and for quickly 
    analyzing and sharing meta-analyses. 
    Provides output to quickly fill in GRADE summary-of-findings 
    tables. 
    Importantly, it allows further processing of the results 
    inside R, in case more specific analyses are needed.
